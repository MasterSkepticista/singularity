I graduated from Nirma University, with an Electronics major, June'20. And yes I survived the great economic depresssion due to COVID.

Now the elephant in the room: I have been affiliated to many ‘hot-topics’ in Computer Science and Engineering.

Guess no more.

It’s Robotics and Machine Learning. But this ain’t the place I brag on what I achieved, nor put my visionary quotes.

1. My CV has got a job of doing that.
2. I don’t feel like doing it.
3. I write here because I like fixing stuff (that's what engineers do).

All this aside, I’ve sometimes been received upon by my peers as a good mentor. I don’t know how well that goes for you, but give it a try if you want to.

I’ll make sure you won’t return disappointed.
